# LightWeight-RBSMRSA
The algorithm is tested with different input sizes containing alphanumeric values and 
special characters. Performance analysis is done to validate and conclude that the algorithm is less 
complex, faster, and secure when compared to the base paper algorithm. The avalanche effect is 
improved up to 49.19% and the overall computational complexity is reduced to O(n). 

In future work, the algorithm can be improved more by increasing the avalanche effect.                     
In addition, it can be also extended to other character encoding methods without increasing the 
complexity of the algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm can be studied by using it in the 
field of IoT and embedded systems or any other resource-constraint fields.
